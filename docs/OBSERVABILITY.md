# Observability

This template ships a generic observability pattern that separates service health from run-level debugging.

## Two Layers

### Platform layer

Use the platform layer for service-level visibility:

`journald -> Promtail -> Loki -> Grafana`

This layer answers questions such as:
- Did the unit start?
- Is the service failing repeatedly?
- Are multiple services showing the same error pattern?

### App layer

Use the app layer for run- or task-level debugging:
- structured JSONL logs
- optional session artifact directories
- manifest metadata for a specific run

This layer answers questions such as:
- What happened in this specific task?
- Which phase failed?
- Which structured payloads were emitted during the run?

## When To Use Which Layer

- Service state, startup failures, timer execution, or cross-service history: use the platform layer first.
- One task, one session, one pipeline run, or one batch execution: use the app layer.
- If you do not know whether the process ran at all: start with `systemctl` and `journalctl`, then drill into app-level artifacts if the unit did run.

## Structured Logging Pattern

The template includes `src/logging_config.py` with:
- human-readable stderr logging by default
- optional JSONL file output for machine-readable run logs
- `contextvars` correlation fields for `session_id`, `task_id`, and `phase`

Recommended pattern:
1. Call `configure_logging()` at startup.
2. Set correlation fields once at the start of a task or session with `set_log_context(...)`.
3. Attach structured payloads with `extra={...}`.
4. Reset or replace the context when the task boundary changes.

Example:

```python
import logging

from src.logging_config import configure_logging, set_log_context

logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)

configure_logging(jsonl_path="data/sessions/run-1/worker.jsonl")
set_log_context(session_id="run-1", task_id="job-42", phase="fetch")
logger.info("Task started", extra={"event": "task_started", "queue": "default"})
```

## Loki Label Conventions

When shipping logs to a shared Loki stack, prefer a stable component label:

```text
component="swe-study-guide"
```

That keeps queries predictable across projects:

```logql
{component="swe-study-guide"}
```

## systemd Unit Naming

Use unit names that match the component label and the job role:
- `swe-study-guide.service`
- `swe-study-guide-<job>.service`
- `swe-study-guide-<job>.timer`

This keeps service names, Syslog identifiers, and Loki queries aligned.

For long-running jobs, increase `TimeoutStopSec=` beyond the default so in-flight work has time to finalize cleanly before systemd escalates to `SIGKILL`.

## Health Endpoint Pattern

Projects with an HTTP surface should expose a basic liveness endpoint:

### `GET /health`

Recommended payload shape:

```json
{
  "status": "ok",
  "release": {
    "tag": "v1.2.3",
    "commit": "abc123456789",
    "short_commit": "abc1234",
    "source": "env"
  }
}
```

Use `src/release_info.py` to populate the release metadata.

The study-site server in `serve.py` follows this pattern directly and is the
recommended liveness endpoint for deployment smoke checks.

### `GET /pipeline/health`

For queue- or pipeline-driven projects, expose richer execution state:

```json
{
  "status": "ok",
  "queue_counts": {
    "pending": 3,
    "processing": 1,
    "failed": 0,
    "completed": 18
  },
  "running_jobs": 1,
  "last_triggered_at": "2026-04-27T08:15:00Z",
  "last_loop_error": null,
  "stale_claim_reconciliation": {
    "status": "ok",
    "requeued": 0
  }
}
```

The purpose is to distinguish queue-empty from queue-blocked, blocked-by-running-work, and broken-loop states.

## Operator Runbook

- Did the unit run?
  `journalctl -u swe-study-guide.service -n 100 --no-pager -q`
- What is the current unit state?
  `systemctl status swe-study-guide.service --no-pager`
- Need cross-service search or a longer time window?
  Use Loki or Grafana.
- Need to inspect one specific run?
  Use the app-layer JSONL log or session artifacts when the project adopts that pattern.

## Verifying Loki Ingestion

Start with journald:

```bash
journalctl -u swe-study-guide.service -n 50 --no-pager -q
```

Then verify the stream is queryable in Loki:

```bash
curl -G "$LOKI_URL/loki/api/v1/query_range" \
  --data-urlencode 'query={component="swe-study-guide"}' \
  --data-urlencode "limit=20"
```

## Useful LogQL Queries

```logql
{component="swe-study-guide"}
{component="swe-study-guide"} |= "ERROR"
{component="swe-study-guide"} |~ "task.*completed|task.*failed"
{component="swe-study-guide"} |= "startup"
```

## Optional Session Artifact Pattern

Projects with long-running tasks, workers, or batch jobs may store per-run artifacts under:

```text
data/sessions/<timestamp>_<task-id>/
```

Typical contents:
- `manifest.json`
- `worker.jsonl`
- `trace.zip`
- `network.har`
- other tool-specific artifacts

### Manifest Shape

```json
{
  "session_id": "2026-04-27T081500Z_job-42",
  "started_at": "2026-04-27T08:15:00Z",
  "finished_at": "2026-04-27T08:20:30Z",
  "duration_seconds": 330,
  "outcome": "completed",
  "task": {
    "id": "job-42",
    "kind": "sync"
  },
  "results": {
    "processed": 18
  },
  "error": null
}
```

### Lifecycle

Use a `finally` block so cleanup and manifest writing still happen on failures:
1. Initialize the session directory.
2. Set log context.
3. Run the task.
4. Finalize artifacts and manifest.
5. Detach the JSONL handler if one was created.

### Retention

Recommended knobs:
- `retention_days`
- `max_sessions`

Run cleanup before starting a new session so the artifact store stays bounded.

### Cleanup-On-Success Modes

- `off`: never delete heavy artifacts automatically
- `failures`: keep heavy artifacts only for failed or cancelled runs
- `always`: always clean heavy artifacts after finalization

### Optional Archive Sink

Projects that need durable artifact retention can add a pluggable archive sink such as S3. This template documents the pattern only; it does not implement an archive backend.
