# Setup Guide

This guide walks you through setting up swe-study-guide for development or usage.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.10 or higher
- pip (Python package installer)
- git

### Optional

- [List optional dependencies]

## Installation

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/alex3m6/swe-study-guide.git
cd swe-study-guide
```

### 2. Create Virtual Environment

```bash
# Create virtual environment
python3 -m venv venv

# Activate virtual environment
source venv/bin/activate  # On macOS/Linux
# venv\Scripts\activate   # On Windows
```

### 3. Install Dependencies

```bash
# Install production dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Install development dependencies (optional)
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
```

### 4. Configure the Application

```bash
# Copy example configuration
cp config/config.example.yaml config/config.yaml

# Edit configuration with your settings
# On macOS/Linux:
nano config/config.yaml
# Or use your preferred editor
```

You can also start from environment variables instead:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your local values
```

### 5. Verify Installation

```bash
# Run tests to verify setup
pytest

# Or run the application
python -m src.main --help
```

## Configuration

### config/config.yaml

The main configuration file. See `config/config.example.yaml` for all available options.

```yaml
# Application settings
app:
  debug: false
  log_level: INFO

# Add your configuration sections
```

### Environment Variables

You can also configure the application using environment variables:

| Variable | Description | Default |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `APP_DEBUG` | Enable debug mode | `false` |
| `APP_LOG_LEVEL` | Logging level | `INFO` |

### YAML vs `.env`

Both configuration styles are included so a new project can choose the lighter-weight approach that fits its runtime model.

- Use `config/config.yaml` when your project naturally groups structured or nested settings.
- Use `.env` when deployment platforms, process managers, or local tooling already revolve around environment variables.
- `python-dotenv` is included so projects can load a local `.env` file during development without exporting each variable manually.
- It is reasonable to ship both examples and let the application define precedence between YAML and environment variables.

## Session Notes

This template treats session notes as committed project history, not private scratch files.

- Read [AGENTS.md](../AGENTS.md) for the delivery workflow rules that govern when notes should be updated.
- Read [notes/README.md](../notes/README.md) for the directory layout, note style, and the daily-note template.
- Daily notes live at `notes/YYYY/MM/YYYY-MM-DD.md`.
- If you want the optional secondary summary-log workflow, copy `notes/.notes-config.yaml.example` to `notes/.notes-config.yaml` and customize the paths for your environment.
- The canonical skill source for note automation lives at `ai-skills/swe-study-guide-session-notes/`. If you use the shared AI-skills deployment pattern, deploy that skill to your local agent harnesses after editing it.

## MCP Configuration

The template ships `.mcp.json.example` as a generic starting point for local MCP server configuration.

```bash
cp .mcp.json.example .mcp.json
```

Then customize the server list for your project and local tools.

- `.mcp.json` is intentionally ignored by git because each developer's MCP setup is local.
- Keep `.mcp.json.example` generic and safe to commit.
- If your project depends on a required MCP server, document that requirement here or in a project-specific operations guide.

## Development Setup

### Install Pre-commit Hooks

```bash
# Install pre-commit hooks
pre-commit install

# Verify hooks work
pre-commit run --all-files
```

Because this template includes the official `gitleaks` hook, the `pre-commit>=3.6.0` requirement in `requirements-dev.txt` matters: modern `pre-commit` can bootstrap the hook's Go toolchain automatically.

### Enable Repository Security Features

After the repository exists on GitHub, review and enable the baseline security features described in [SECURITY_BASELINE.md](SECURITY_BASELINE.md):

- secret scanning
- push protection
- CodeQL default setup

These features are configured in GitHub, not in the local bootstrap commands above.

### Deploy AI Skills

The template ships canonical AI skill sources under `ai-skills/` and a deploy flow that renders them to both Claude and Codex:

```bash
./scripts/deploy_ai_skills.sh
```

Requirements:
- `ansible-playbook` installed locally
- write access to `~/.claude/skills/` and `~/.codex/skills/`

The deploy script renders:
- Claude skills to `~/.claude/skills/<name>/skill.md`
- Codex skills to `~/.codex/skills/<name>/SKILL.md`
- Codex interface metadata to `~/.codex/skills/<name>/agents/openai.yaml`

The shipped skill names are project-specific after setup, for example
`swe-study-guide-feature-delivery`, so this project does not overwrite another
project's installed `feature-delivery` skill.

See [AI_SKILLS.md](AI_SKILLS.md) for the canonical source layout, starter skills, and troubleshooting guidance.

### Claude Permissions And Fewer Prompts

`.claude/settings.local.json` is the committed baseline allowlist for Claude Code in this template.

- Expand it when the project consistently uses the same safe local commands.
- Keep the list narrow enough that new or risky commands still require a prompt.
- Treat it as an audit trail for the "fewer permission prompts" workflow rather than a place to allow everything.

Typical additions in this template include:
- `git` and `gh` commands used during issue delivery
- `pre-commit`, `pytest`, and static-analysis commands
- `gitleaks` when you run manual repository scans outside pre-commit
- `ansible-playbook` and the local AI-skills deploy wrapper
- common filesystem inspection commands needed during template setup work

### Line Length Recommendation

The template defaults `127` to `127`.

- It aligns with Black and the rest of the code-quality configuration in this template.
- It fits modern editor widths better than older narrow defaults.
- It reduces avoidable line-break noise in pull requests while remaining readable in split views.

### IDE Setup

#### VS Code

Recommended extensions:
- Python
- Pylance
- Black Formatter
- isort

Settings (`.vscode/settings.json`):
```json
{
    "python.defaultInterpreterPath": "./venv/bin/python",
    "python.formatting.provider": "black",
    "editor.formatOnSave": true,
    "[python]": {
        "editor.codeActionsOnSave": {
            "source.organizeImports": true
        }
    }
}
```

#### PyCharm

1. Set Python interpreter to `./venv/bin/python`
2. Enable Black formatter
3. Enable isort for imports

## Troubleshooting
