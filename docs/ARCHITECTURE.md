# Architecture Documentation

This document describes the technical architecture of swe-study-guide.

## Overview

[High-level description of the system architecture]

## Delivery And Deployment Control Plane

The template now includes a deployment control plane alongside the application scaffold:

- `.github/workflows/release.yml` is the operator entry point for manual and release-driven deployments
- `scripts/github/resolve_release_context.py` converts trigger-specific GitHub metadata into stable deployment inputs
- `scripts/redeploy.sh` and `scripts/release_smoke_check.sh` define the handoff between GitHub Actions and the infrastructure playbooks
- `infra/hetzner/`, `infra/home-worker/`, and `infra/site/` provide the inventory, secrets, and orchestration skeletons that projects customize per environment
